Looking for a new solution in project management and employee time management?
Kinetiq might be what you're looking for! The platform serves as a medium for
all your operations as a project manager to your employees and/or clients.
It also allows simple registration of work times per project, task, meetings and more.

<h2 style="color: orange">Kinetiq is currently work in progress and unavailable to customers.</h2>

Kinetiq works with a dedicated stack and guidelines to ensure code readability and understanding.

We work with:
- Laravel for back-end and API communication to back-end
- Vue for front-end and page routing.
- SCSS/SASS for front-end styling
- Axios for communication to Laravel API routes
- MariaDB/MySQL for database provisioning
